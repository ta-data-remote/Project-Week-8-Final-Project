## Project Description
 Information found online about a study made by the Wisconsin University. With the information provided, try to predict if the cancer is benign or malignant, depending on specific features. Tried 4 different models, with diff Scalers.

## Questions & Hypotheses
Is it possible to predict breast cancer depending on features (breast mass).

## Dataset
I found data in https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/breast-cancer-wisconsin-data and https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Breast+Cancer+Wisconsin+%28Diagnostic%29.

## Workflow
Outline the workflow you used in your project. What are the steps you went through?
- find a topic
- cleaning the data
- analysis and conclusions
- plots and visual elements
- building the different models and trying them
- prepare presentation
- prepare files, folder and readme file

## Organization
How did you organize your work? Did you use any tools like a kanban board?
I followed the Workflow points mentioned above.

What does your repository look like? Explain your folder and file structure.
Apart from the .gitignore and the Readme file, you will find a folder with the code (your-code) and 1 with the data. Also in the 'your-code' folder you'll find the plots I used for the presentation and 1 further jupiter notebook including extra infos about the dataset.

## Links
Include links to your repository, slides and kanban board. Feel free to include any other links associated with your project.
